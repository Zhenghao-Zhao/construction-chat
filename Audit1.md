### The client's vision
SignOnSite is developing a tool for construction workers when they work on site. Its core functionalities will allow users to communicate with each other anywhere on the site, broadcast messages to fellow users, and easily find key information from chat history. <br/>
These functionalities will ultimately make construction site a safer workplace, more communicative and improve its progression speed.

### Our assignment
Our mission for the rest of the semester is to <br>
1.  Build a **chat application** that best works across all platforms (IOS, Android and web application)
2.  Add **AI technologies** to help achieve client's expectations with this app.


### Client and other stakeholder expectations
Stakeholders:
-   SignOnSite.
-   Construction Companies and their employees.

Client expectations: 
-   Expects us to implement the chat application with embedded AI technology. However, if progress is not as expected, a proof of concept would also be helpful.
-   Our team:
We aim to implement subtasks first and build up incrementally to meet client’s expectations. 

### How your project will make things better for the client and other stakeholders
1. The project we have is one of the core functionalities that would be on the existing SignOnSite native application. 
2. As described in ‘client’s vision and objective’, it helps users communicate, and makes construction site to be a safer, communicative, and efficient workplace.
3. Throughout this project, we will learn a lot as individual from each other and as a team. It also helps us move forward towards out degrees and future careers.


### Project milestones, scheduling and deliverables for the semester
Audit 1: Provide our understanding of the deliverables, planning for the rest of semester, and understanding client’s expectations and our objectives. <br/>
Audit 2: A prototype chat application. <br/>
Audit 3: AI functionality embedded in the chat application.

### Technical and other constraints (eg. reliability, security, safety)
Reliability:
1. Limited experience in native app development.
2. Each proficient in different technologies, time is needed to bring everyone on the same page.
3. Part-time development (being full time students).
4. Lack of knowledge in construction work processes.
5. As follow-up of 4 - lack of data sources.

### Identification of resources, risks, potential costs and who will bear them
- Resources:
    1. Some people we know who work/worked in construction.
    2. Online forums (Stackoverflow, Quora, Reddit etc).
    3. All forms of educational resources (Youtube coding tutorials, materials on making native apps, etc)
-   Potential risks:
    1. Not completing our tasks in a timely fashion, which will affect completion of a subsequent milestone.
    2. Lack of data.
-   Monetary concern:
    1. TechLauncher has offered up to 300 dollars for our spendings for the project.
    2. SignOnSite has offered help and is willing to purchase the final product if it works well.
Overall, if necessary, our team will calculate a budget and consult our clients and TechLauncher before we ask for their support.
    3. Overall we think the main cost will be on using mainstream software development tools. Exact figures are to be determined.

### Completion of Non-Disclosure Agreement and any Intellectual Property concerns
The agreement is due to be discussed with ANUSA lawyer next Monday under an appointment. We have informed our clients of the news.
