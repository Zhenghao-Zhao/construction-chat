# Week 3 Client Meeting

## We decided the main functions of the chat app:
-   P2P
-   Broadcast
-   Roles
-   Warning
-   On/off site status
-   Voice message

## From this list, the MVP has;
-   Broadcast
-   Roles
-   On/off site status
-   Voice message (option)

## Notes:
-   Warning can be part of the broadcast function.
-   The current implementation for Roles is binary - either manager or not manager.
-   Often construction workers are not reachable.
-   Voice message is great but not essential for MVP.
-   Current location system is not as precise.
-   We need to write server side code too (but later).
-   This chat app is meant to be work-use only. Different UIs for sign on and off.
-   We have someone experienced in construction workflow we can ask questions.
