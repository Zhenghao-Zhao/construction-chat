# Audit 2
In the last audit, we talked about our understanding on client’s expectations of our project. We received great feedback from you guys and we did not waste them in our progress towards this audit. <br>
<br>
Here is a quick summary of what we learned and amended from week 3 audit:
##  Lack of communication amongst team members
-	We increased our meeting times from once per week to twice per week in addition to client’s meeting.
-	Our responding time on Slack has been much better.
-	Team members have been more proactive in creating and completing tasks (we will show the results later).

## 	Lack of design and planning
-	We have made more efforts in making useful diagrams: user stories, use case diagram, flow chart, Gantt chart, UI design models and class diagram.
-	Each member has a dedicated role in meetings and now at future coding.
-	A project calendar has been made and published.

##	Limited understanding of Construction Chat
-	We tried different ways to understand a construction environment: calling a friend who works in construction for over 6 years; observing construction sites; online research (see document appendix).
-	We understand the structure of construction site better now and have used it to making all our designs so far. My friend is committed to answering future questions.
-	Our client is happy with our UI design.
