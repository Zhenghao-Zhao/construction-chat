## About the potentil user
He has been working in construction in Perth for over 6 years as a construction worker.

## Questions
1.  How often do you use mobile phone?
2.  Are you allowed to view messages on a construction site?
3.  How do you communicate on a site?
4.  How do managers make announcement to workers?
5.  What happens when emergency happens?
6.  What is the first thing you do before your work on a site?

##  Answers
1.  Seldomly. But occasionally I use mobile phone to check messages.
2.  It's not allowed during the work. A supervisor would walk around the site to
make sure everyone is working.
3.  If some small problem happens, I would talk to the supervisor first. In the case
of machine breakdown, insufficient supplies, etc. the supervisor would talk to the manager
because it might require him communicate with his supervisor to arrange buying new material, etc.
4.  The manager mostly sits in a office. In the case of a Chinese manager he could make small announcements through
WeChat (a Chinese chat app), otherwise through emails.
5.  I would run straight to the manager's office and talk to him.
6.  Sign up on a paper sheet, and sign off before you leave the site after work.

## Comments
-   The app might be useful for the manager, but not so much for other workers.
-   It would be nice to include a file upload function. Voice messaging is nice, but typing is inevitable.
-   It would be nice to have a blueprint viewing function for workers.
