Background
Our client want us to develop a cross platform app that included Android, IOS and web browser. Basically there are two ways to do that: separate development or using cross platform framework. 

Analysis -- Native, Web or Hybrid Apps
Introduction of Native, Web or Hybrid Apps


Web apps is similar to website, however a apps is more focus on the functionality, like facebook, ebay, while a website is mainly about informations. Web app develop mainly use JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5. 

Native Apps are most of the Apps on your phone. They usually have more features that Web apps and that’s because they can call those hardwares directly from your phone rather than from browser. And because of that, It can stay running  background. That’s means some functions like Push notifications is doable. Since Android and IOS using different OS core, Native Apps need separate development, they using even different language, Swift or Objective-C is used to write native iOS apps, Java is used to write native Android apps, and C# for the most part for Windows Phone apps.

“If a native app and a web app got married and had a kid, it would be a hybrid app.”
For developing a hybrid Apps we need to set a webview(browser) first then coding like a web app. That’s meant we only need to code once and get products in both version.


**Comparison of Native, Web or Hybrid Apps**


| __ Types of app__ | __pros__ | __cons__ |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| Native| Perfect performance, stable, call local resource (album...), system level notification   | High effort on both develop and maintain, slow update, slow and high cost on distribution     |
| Web | Low effort, quick update,cross platforms| Limited by browser-- not system level, temporary portal, low performance    |
| Hybrid | Good performance,  stable, call local resource (album...), system level notification, quick update,cross platforms| Heavily depend on webview    |


So
Since our client want cross platform and we have only 5 developers. Hybrid could be the better choice. Btw,  so far as I know many other techlauncher projects also use this one, like a fashion?

**Frameworks of Hybrid**

If you just google ‘hybrid app framework’ you will wons of ‘top 5 …..in 2018’ however they are similar.

This an updated analysis article compared 5 frameworks.
We need to check those difference and choose.
Base on my research there are more learning material for React Native and Ionic than others.
